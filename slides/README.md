# Why
This is a course for using git, in French, giving at Polytech Lille, part of the University of Lille.

# Compiling

`lualatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape slides.tex`

If you need to use pdflatex, it compiles fine, but you should uncomment `%\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` in `CM-preamble.sty`
